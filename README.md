# Rogueblight 
Rogueblight is a semi-large (3.3 KLOC) multi-user dungeon game and platform.
It is written in java with a gradle build system.
It is written using many OOP concepts such as inheritence, polymorphism, the component system, events, etc. 
It will be able to run as a server, or as a local game.
It is built for extreme expansibility using plugins. 
It will run on every JVM platform. It is mildly asynchronous.
